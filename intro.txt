War... War never changes.
Since the beginning, we have been taken by greed,
violence, and hatred. But no matter how hard we try,
we can't escape...
It's the year 2022...
Trump's damage has been done, it's irreversible. All
the attempts to stop what he was going to do had failed.

And war... War never changes.
